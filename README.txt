The game "HackerMaze" has two players cooperate in order to find sensitive government data quickly while avoiding obstacles.

Feeling:
We want the players to feel like they need to cooperate; one player shouldn't be easily able to finish this game.
Over progression in the levels, they should feel more and more tense as the race against time gets longer.
They should feel that the sounds enhance the experience and fit with the theme.
They should not feel confused when the level ends or when they lose.

Other:
We made most of our assets, but took a few from third party entities.
There is a known issue with occasional crashing. We are not sure how to fix it since it seems inconsistent.
